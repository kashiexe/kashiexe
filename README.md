### About Me ✏️
- 👨‍💻 I'm currently a 17 year old doing a gap year for university, the reason for it is listed in the last bulletpoint!
- 🌐 I'm a **Node.js and C++ Developer** with experience on a big diversity of projects.
- 🎮 I'm also kinda big into games, so if you ever need someone to play with, you can always contact me.
- 🌌 I love studying **AstroPhysics** and I'd love to be able to study it further on a job within that branch in the future.
- 📚 Currently learning **LLVM** and compiler development for a project I'm working on called ミシ（mishi）.
- 🌍 Currently Learning **Japanese** and **German** as well, planning to study CS in Germany in about a year and maybe even work in Japan in the future!
  
**tldr:** 17, on a gap year studying german for university, C++ and JS experience, currently working on a project


### Projects to Showcase 📋
As of right now, the projects in showcase are pinned, but in the future I'm planning on putting non-open source projects displayed in this section as well.
As stated earlier though, there are projects that I haven't published yet, such as mishi, but once the first version is finished, it will be published :)

### Contact & Website 📩
working on the website, you can contact me through my discord though (kashidev) :P (if you do decide to contact me, please say you come from github so I know you're not one of those nitro gift beggars or something)

### Mishi's Progress (Current Project) 🌟
Here's a quick showcase of what I'm currently doing/already did for mishi, keep in mind mishi is a compiled programming language so you'll see a LOT of compiler-related goals. (This is entirely made in **C++** btw)

#### Part 1 - AST Parser 🌳
- [x] Tokenizer >> Tokenizes source code into a list of differentiating tokens (13/15)
- [ ] UParser >> Applies syntax-related rules into the tokens, converting them into nodes that each have a different type of purpose, pushing them in a tree type of thing.
