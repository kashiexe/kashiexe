### About Me ✏️
- 👨‍💻 I'm currently an 18 year old doing a gap year for university, the reason for it is listed in the last bulletpoint!
- 🌐 I'm a **Node.js and C++ Developer** with experience on a big diversity of projects.
- 🎮 I'm also kinda big into games, so if you ever need someone to play with, you can always contact me.
- 🌌 I love studying **AstroPhysics** and I'd love to be able to study it further on a job within that branch in the future.
- 📚 Currently learning **LLVM**, compiler development and other stuff :).
- 🌍 Currently Learning **Japanese** and **German** as well, planning to study CS in Germany in about a year and maybe even work in Japan in the future!
  
**tldr:** 18, on a gap year studying german for university, C++ and JS experience.

### Projects to Showcase 📋
As of right now, the projects in showcase are pinned, but in the future I'm planning on putting non-open source projects displayed in this section as well.
As stated earlier though, there are projects that I haven't published yet, such as mishi, but once the first version is finished, it will be published :)

### Contact & Website 📩
working on the website, you can contact me through my discord though (kashidev) :P (if you do decide to contact me, please say you come from github so I know you're not one of those nitro gift beggars or something)
